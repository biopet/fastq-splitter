# FastqSplitter


This tool divides a fastq file into smaller fastq files, based on the number of output files specified. For ecample,
if one specifies 5 output files, it will split the fastq into 5 files of equal size. This can be very useful if one
wants to use the chunking option in a pipeline: FastqSplitter can generate the exact number of fastq files
(chunks) as needed.

This tool will divide the fastq files in files of equal length.
