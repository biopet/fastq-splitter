#  FastqSplitter
This tool is part of BIOPET tool suite that is developed at LUMC by [the SASC team](http://sasc.lumc.nl/). 
Each tool in the BIOPET tool suite is meant to offer a standalone function that can be used to perform a
dedicate data analysis task or added as part of [BIOPET pipelines](http://biopet-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

#  About this tool
This tool divides a fastq file into smaller fastq files, based on the number of output files specified. For ecample,
if one specifies 5 output files, it will split the fastq into 5 files of equal size. This can be very useful if one
wants to use the chunking option in one of our pipelines: FastqSplitter can generate the exact number of fastq files
(chunks) as needed. This tool is used internally in our pipelines as required.
